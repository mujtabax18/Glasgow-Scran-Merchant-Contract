GENERAL SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS 
Glasgow Scran may amend the Supplemental Terms from time to time, as allowed by Applicable Law, upon giving a reasonable Notice Period and by Glasgow Scran posting such amended Supplemental Terms on this website or Glasgow Scran otherwise making such amended Supplemental Terms available to Merchant. However, the Notice Period will not apply where an amendment is required by law or relates to the expansion or introduction of new services or functionalities to the existing Glasgow Scran Services and/or Glasgow Scran Tools or any other change which is effectively favourable to Merchant and does not reduce the scope of its rights or increase its responsibilities. Merchant’s continued access to or use of the Glasgow Scran Services and/or Glasgow Scran Tools after such amended Supplemental Terms become effective constitutes Merchant’s consent to be bound by the amended Supplemental Terms. If Merchant objects to any amended Supplemental Term, Merchant may terminate this Agreement in accordance with clause IV of the Order Form. 
1. 	Glasgow Scran Services.  
a.	General. Glasgow Scran and/or its Affiliates will make the applicable Glasgow Scran Services available to Merchant including, but not limited to, on-demand lead generation, payment processing, marketing, operational and other support.

If reasonable, Glasgow Scran may adjust the transfer of Item Revenue collected on Merchant’s behalf for reasons including, but not limited to, failure to fulfil the provision of an Item as ordered. Merchant may dispute any such adjustments through the Glasgow Scran Tools within fourteen (14) calendar days of Merchant being notified of such adjustment. Glasgow Scran reserves the right to, and Merchant authorizes Glasgow Scran to, collect the amount of such adjustments via a deduction from the Item Revenue collected on Merchant’s behalf, or by debiting Merchant’s payment method on record, or otherwise seeking reimbursement from Merchant.  
v.	In exceptional circumstances only (as determined by Glasgow Scran in its sole discretion, acting reasonably), Glasgow Scran reserves the right to temporarily or permanently cancel or suspend a payment to Merchant. The foregoing exceptional circumstances shall include, but not be limited to, any legal or regulatory risk or potential breach of Applicable Laws associated with the transfer of such payment to Merchant, the actual or expected initiation of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings against Merchant and any failure by Merchant to provide the Required Documentation in accordance with clause 1(j) of these General Supplemental Terms.

Glasgow Scran may, from time to time, request information from Merchant to confirm Merchant’s identity as may be necessary under any applicable compliance obligations before transferring any payments to Merchant and may refuse to process payments owed to Merchant in accordance with clause 1(b)(vi) of these General Supplemental Terms if there exists a legal or regulatory risk or potential breach of law or regulation associated with such transfer to Merchant. 
vii.	Glasgow Scran may engage any of its Affiliates to perform the activity of limited payment collection agent. Such engagement may be subject to additional terms.

The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defence of a claim, at Indemnifying Party’s expense.

Merchant shall not cancel or materially reduce its insurance without thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Glasgow Scran.

14.	Governing Law and Dispute Resolution. 
a.	Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Scotland without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  
b.	Dispute Resolution. In the event of any Dispute, the parties shall first endeavour an amicable settlement by good faith consultation and negotiation. If the parties fail to reach a settlement within two (2) months of receipt of a dispute notice, the Dispute shall be finally settled in accordance with the rules of the DIFC-LCIA Arbitration Centre (the “Centre”) under the Arbitration Rules of the Centre (as amended from time to time, and as then-current at the time of lodging of the dispute, the “Rules”) by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with such Rules.

This clause 14.b shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales. 
15. 	General.  
a.	Waiver. The failure of either party to enforce, at any time or for any period of time, the provisions hereof, or the failure of either party to exercise any option herein, shall not be construed as a waiver of such provision or option and shall in no way affect that party’s right to enforce such provisions or exercise such option.  
b.	Modification. Any modification or amendment to the Order Form shall be effective only if in writing and signed by both parties, provided that Glasgow Scran reserves the right to modify any information referenced at hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time. Any modification or amendment to the Supplemental Terms shall be in accordance with clause II(B) of the Order Form. 
c.	Severability. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision or part thereof shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of the Agreement but the legality, validity and enforceability of the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected. In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable (part of the) provision with a (part of a) provision that is legal, valid and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable (part of the) provision, given the contents and purpose of the Agreement. 
d.	Force Majeure Event. Any delay in or failure by either party in the performance of this Agreement shall be excused if and to the extent such delay or failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event. The affected party will promptly notify the other party upon becoming aware that any Force Majeure has occurred or is likely to occur and will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any resulting delay in or interference with the performance of its obligations under the Agreement.  
e.	Assignment. Merchant may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Glasgow Scran. Glasgow Scran may assign or transfer this Agreement or any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, under this Agreement without consent or notification. Glasgow Scran shall be expressly discharged from all obligations and responsibilities arising after the assignment or transfer. Subject to the foregoing, this 
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each party hereto and its respective successors and assigns.  
f.	Relationship between the Parties. The parties expressly agree that: (a) this Agreement is not an employment agreement, nor does it create an employment or worker relationship (including from a labour law, tax law or social security law perspective), between Glasgow Scran (and/or its Affiliates) and Merchant or Glasgow Scran (and/or its Affiliates) and any Delivery Partners; and (b) except as specified in this Agreement, no joint venture, partnership, or agency relationship exists between Glasgow Scran (and/or Glasgow Scran’s Affiliates) and Merchant or Glasgow Scran (and/or Glasgow Scran’s Affiliates) and any Delivery Partners. No party shall have the right to enter into contracts on behalf of, to legally bind, to incur debt on behalf of, or to otherwise incur any liability or obligation on behalf of, the other party hereto, in the absence of a separate writing, executed by an authorized representative of the other party. Each party shall be solely responsible for its employees and contractors used in connection with this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein with respect to Glasgow Scran acting as the limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of collecting payment from Customers on behalf of Merchant, the relationship between the parties under this Agreement is solely that of independent contractors.  
g.	Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the full and complete understanding and agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior and contemporary understandings and agreements, whether oral or written. In this Agreement, the words "including" and "include" mean "including, but not limited to."  
h.	Third Party Beneficiaries. Merchant acknowledges that there are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement, except for Glasgow Scran B.V. (in its capacity as agent for Glasgow Scran) and Glasgow Scran’s Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall be interpreted to create any third-party beneficiary claims, except with respect to Glasgow Scran B.V. (in its capacity as agent for Glasgow Scran) and Glasgow Scran’s Affiliates. 
i.	Liability. Nothing herein limits or excludes (nor is intended to limit or exclude) any statutory rights that Merchant or Glasgow Scran may have under Applicable Laws that cannot be lawfully limited or excluded. 
j.	Payment Processing Errors. Glasgow Scran reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to seek reimbursement from Merchant if Glasgow Scran discovers payment processing errors. Glasgow Scran may deduct from Merchant's Item Revenue, debit Merchant's payment method on file, or seek reimbursement from Merchant by any other lawful means to correct any errors. Merchant authorizes Glasgow Scran to use any or all of the above methods to seek reimbursement. 
k.	Notice. Any notice will be sent to the address of the relevant party listed in the Order Form and deemed duly given: (a) upon actual delivery, if delivery is by hand; or (b) three (3) days after being sent by overnight courier, charges prepaid; or (c) by electronic mail to the designated recipient.  
l.	Marketplace Cash Orders. Glasgow Scran may facilitate a delivery option to Customers in the Territory that allows them to pay for a given Marketplace Item provided by Merchant and all associated fees and charges resulting from that transaction in cash (a "Marketplace Cash Order").
m.	Collections. Notwithstanding the appointment of Glasgow Scran by Merchant as its limited payment collection agent under the Agreement, in the event of a Marketplace Cash Order request by a Customer, Merchant authorizes a Marketplace Delivery Partner to collect the Marketplace Item Payment sold by Merchant via the Glasgow Scran App (including any VAT or other sales tax) from the Customers on behalf of Merchant. Glasgow Scran’s role as Merchant’s agent with regard to Marketplace Cash Collections shall be to collect the Marketplace Payment and Glasgow Scran’s Marketplace Service Fee from Marketplace Delivery Partners by either obtaining the funds electronically or offsetting such amounts from funds otherwise due to Marketplace Delivery Partners from their delivery services in aggregate generated on the Glasgow Scran App. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that collection shall be the responsibility of the Marketplace Delivery Partner. If for whatever reason Marketplace Delivery Partner’s electronic payment to Glasgow Scran is delayed or unsuccessful, Glasgow Scran, in its capacity as Merchant’s collection agent, will act as a fall-back and ensure receipt of payment by Merchant. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that in consideration of Glasgow Scran’s provision of lead generation, demand prediction, and other related services provided via the Glasgow Scran App under the Agreement, Merchant owes Glasgow Scran the respective Marketplace Service Fee, regardless of collections related to the attempted or completed deliveries. Glasgow Scran shall not be deemed to have waived its right to any amounts owed by Merchant if: (a) there are insufficient payment card order to set off against; (b) Merchant does not timely repay any amounts owed to Glasgow Scran; or (c) Glasgow Scran elects to require a minimum amount owed prior to initiating collection efforts or otherwise delays collecting amounts owed by Merchant. Glasgow Scran reserves the right to suspend Merchant’s account if Merchant maintains a negative balance for more than one (1) week. With each payment statement, Glasgow Scran shall report any offsetting and deductions.
